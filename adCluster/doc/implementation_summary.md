# EditorPage Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the EditorPage component based on the task checklist in task.md.

## Overview

The EditorPage component is a rich text editor built with Tiptap that provides advanced editing capabilities including:
- Rich text formatting
- File and note tree management
- Reference management and citation
- Custom content insertion (equations, file attachments)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Core Editor Setup
- Installed all required Tiptap dependencies
- Set up three Tiptap editor instances (header, main, footer)
- Configured extensions for rich text editing

### 2. UI Components
- **LeftPanel**: File/note tree view with project/library/references/tasks tabs
- **TopMenuBar**: Formatting tools, insertion tools, and AI support features
- **TiptapEditor**: Main editor container with header/main/footer sections
- **StatusBar**: Character and word count display
- **RightSidebar**: Project details, references, and collaboration features

### 3. Custom Extensions
- **CustomParagraph**: Paragraph with indent/outdent functionality
- **EquationNode**: LaTeX equation rendering using KaTeX
- **FileAttachmentNode**: File attachment display with download functionality
- **DataTag**: Inline data tags for metadata

### 4. Data Management
- Mock data structures for tree nodes, documents, and references
- State management for selected nodes and document details
- Reference management (add/delete functionality)

### 5. Styling
- Comprehensive CSS for all components
- Responsive layout with three-panel design
- Custom styling for Tiptap content

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
All required Tiptap extensions and supporting libraries have been installed:
- @tiptap/react, @tiptap/core, and various extensions
- katex for equation rendering
- prosemirror-view for editor styling

### Component Structure
```

├── LeftPanel
├── Editor Container
│   ├── TopMenuBar
│   ├── TiptapEditor
│   │   ├── Header Editor
│   │   ├── Main Editor
│   │   └── Footer Editor

```

### State Management
- Used React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for state management
- Implemented callback functions for inter-component communication
- Managed document and reference data with mock data structures

### Custom Extensions
Each custom extension follows Tiptap's extension API:
- CustomParagraph extends the base Paragraph extension with indent functionality
- EquationNode uses ReactNodeViewRenderer to render KaTeX equations
- FileAttachmentNode displays file information with download capability
- DataTag provides inline metadata tags

## Testing
- Created a basic test file to verify component rendering
- Verified TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Confirmed development server starts without issues

## Future Improvements
- Connect to real backend API for data persistence
- Implement collaboration features
- Add more AI-powered editing tools
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
