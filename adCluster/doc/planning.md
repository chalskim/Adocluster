## Priority Implementation Order

3. **Organization tools** - Calendar, Source Management, Resource Management
4. **Utility features** - Import/Export, Search
5. **Settings** - General Settings, Admin Settings

## Technical Considerations

- All mock data should be clearly identifiable as mock data
- Temporary messages should be styled consistently
- URL connections should use proper React Router navigation
- Button behaviors should provide user feedback
- All new functionality should follow existing code patterns
- Error handling should be consistent across all components
