# CORS Error Fix Report

## Issue Description
The frontend application was unable to log in due to a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error:
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/auth/login' from origin 'http://localhost:5175' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The backend server was not configured to allow requests from the frontend origin `http://localhost:5175`. The CORS middleware in the backend only allowed requests from:
- `http://localhost:5174` (from environment variable or default)
- `http://localhost:5173` (explicitly added)

But the frontend was running on `http://localhost:5175` due to port conflicts.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated CORS Configuration
Modified `/Users/nicchals/src/ADOCluster/AdclusterServer/main.py` to include `http://localhost:5175` in the allowed origins:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        os.getenv("FRONTEND_URL", "http://localhost:5174"),
        "http://localhost:5173",  # Add this for development
        "http://localhost:5175"   # Add this for development
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### 2. Server Restart
- Killed all processes using ports 8000 (backend) and 5173-5175 (frontend)
- Restarted both backend and frontend servers

## Verification
- Backend server is now running on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend server is now running on http://localhost:5173
- CORS error should be resolved
- Login functionality should work correctly

## Testing Instructions
1. Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Try to log in with valid credentials
3. Verify that no CORS errors appear in the browser console
4. Confirm that the login request completes successfully

## Additional Notes
For future development, it might be beneficial to:
1. Use environment variables for frontend URL configuration
2. Consider using a more flexible CORS configuration for development
3. Ensure consistent port usage across development environments
