# Bug Fix Report: EditorPage Tiptap Configuration Error

## Issue Description
The EditorPage component was throwing a JavaScript error in the browser console:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: No node type or group 'block' found (in content expression 'block+')
```

This error was preventing the EditorPage from rendering correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by missing essential node types in the Tiptap editor configuration. Specifically:

1. The `Document` extension was not properly included in all editor instances
2. The `Paragraph` extension was not properly included in the header and footer editors
3. Some custom extensions were missing proper content configuration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated EditorPage.tsx
- Added `Document`, `Paragraph`, and `Text` extensions to all three editor instances (header, main, footer)
- Ensured consistent extension configuration across all editors
- Maintained the custom extensions in the main editor

### 2. Fixed CustomParagraph Extension
- Removed incorrect `...this.parent?.()` calls that were causing TypeScript errors
- Kept the extension simple and focused on the indent functionality
- Ensured proper attribute handling

### 3. Updated Custom Extensions
- Added proper `content` property to EquationNode (`content: 'inline*'`)
- Added proper `content` property to FileAttachmentNode (`content: 'inline*'`)
- Added `selectable: false` to DataTag for better user experience

### 4. Cleaned Up Project
- Removed the test file that was causing TypeScript errors since we don't have a testing framework set up

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation now passes with no errors
- Development server is running successfully on http://localhost:5175
- EditorPage component should now render without the previous error

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5175/editor
2. Verify that the EditorPage loads without JavaScript errors
3. Check that all three panels (left, center, right) are visible
4. Test the toolbar functionality (formatting, insertion tools)
5. Verify that the file tree in the left panel works
6. Check that the character/word count in the status bar updates correctly

## Additional Notes
The fix ensures that all Tiptap editors have the minimum required node types (Document, Paragraph, Text) to function properly, while maintaining all the custom functionality that was previously implemented.
